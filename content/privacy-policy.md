No information is collected or shared with any third parties.

We collect nothing from visitors of this site beyond what is stored by default in Apache and Nginx logs.

These logs may include:
- Your public IP address (when errors, or large volumes of requests occur)
- Any files you try to access (when errors occur)

By default, Apache and Nginx will store the public IP address of clients when they try to access files that do not exist, or when an unusually large number of requests come in.
